        Unlike other Moon tokens, ours passes the HOWIE test, and is not defined as a security. You see, it turns out there are all these crazy rules and regulations about issuing common stock, and these rules are meant to protect investors from being bomboozled. Believe it or not, these rules apply to blockchain too. The SEC doesn’t care if you use the term ‘Moon’, or if you call the investment ‘Safe’. If it’s a security, it’s a security. 
<br/><br/>
An equity security represents ownership interest held by shareholders in an entity (a company, partnership, or trust), realized in the form of shares of capital stock, which includes shares of both common and preferred stock.  
<br/><br/>
Well, How do we know if something is defined as a Security? <br/><br/><h1>Enter the Howey Test.</h1>
<br/>
The Howey Test refers to the U.S. Supreme Court case for determining whether a transaction qualifies as an "investment contract," and therefore would be considered a security and subject to disclosure and registration requirements under the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
<br/><br/>
Here are the things one needs to consider when creating something that could be legally defined as a security.

Let’s walk through other ‘Moon’ tokens that have received a lot of attention lately, and see if they pass this test?
<br/><br/>
For most of them, the following can be asserted. 
<br/><br/>
1. Is there an investment of money? - Yes. Other Moon tokens are purchased at market evaluation. 
<blockquote style={{padding: '10px', backgroundColor: 'black', borderRadius: '1px solid grey', color: 'blue'}}>
<h1 style={{color: 'red'}}>FAIL</h1>
</blockquote>
2. Does the issuer represent a common enterprise? Yes. If funds were set aside by specific dev’s to complete specific tasks (as opposed to a DAO), and the success of the project depends on those selling the investment. 
<blockquote style={{padding: '10px', backgroundColor: 'black', borderRadius: '1px solid grey', color: 'blue'}}>
<h1 style={{color: 'red'}}>FAIL</h1>
</blockquote>
3. Is there an expectation of profit? Many Moon contracts clearly state that there is an expectation of profit. Infact, the only information on many of these ‘moon’ projects represent financial projections. Unabashedly, there was no usecase upon issuance for most of these ‘moon’ projects outside of a speculative investment. Furthermore, these projects consistently prefixing the celestial entities with the word “SAFE”, could be a legal basis to establish clear intent to defraud uninformed investors who are crypto ‘virgins’, how may have observed the success of bitcoin, but do not understand the unregulated nature of these projects, nor a conceptual basis of the underlying technology. Even Bitconnect wasn’t brazen enough to use words like “SAFE” or “RISK FREE” in the title of their organization. There is no doubt that these projects are raising eyebrows at the SEC.      
<blockquote style={{padding: '10px', backgroundColor: 'black', borderRadius: '1px solid grey', color: 'blue'}}>
<h1 style={{color: 'red'}}>FAIL</h1>
</blockquote>
4. Is the profit derived from the efforts of a third party? As stated in number two there is a clear understanding of these teams as a centralized entity to both manage these funds, profit from them, and in some cases operate like a business directly affiliated with these brand names.
<blockquote style={{padding: '10px', backgroundColor: 'black', borderRadius: '1px solid grey', color: 'blue'}}>
<h1 style={{color: 'red'}}>FAIL</h1>
</blockquote>
<br/><br/>
<h1>How is Mooney different?</h1>
1. Is there an investment of money? - Yes. Outside of the airdrop, one will exchange some form of capital (crypto or otherwise) to acquire the Mooney token.
<blockquote style={{padding: '10px', backgroundColor: 'black', borderRadius: '1px solid grey', color: 'blue'}}>
<h1 style={{color: 'red'}}>FAIL</h1>
</blockquote>
2. Does the issuer represent a common enterprise? Sort of. From inception all tokens which are delegated for specific intentions will be managed by a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization), this abstraction layer does not implicitly mean that the group (although in aqueous in nature) is absolved from this definition. That being said, by leveraging a ‘fair launch’ strategy, where presale tokens are used directly to seed liquidity as a form of utility for the token to function on the exchange in question (not as a fundraising mechanism or profit model that monetarily benefits the members of the DAO). No member of the DAO will be able to profit from or liquidate any form of capital from the liquidity generation event. Think about the liquidity generation event like building one of those monstrous creations at burning man, where everyone chips in to make sure the giant art project has everything it needs to be awesome. Some people chip in wood, gas, LED’s, and at the end of the day whatever comes out of the side is a magnificent creation that appeals to the fantastic vanity of artists. Whether or not the market evaluation of the creation goes up or down is completely irrelevant to the philosophical aims of the DAO.    
<blockquote style={{padding: '10px', backgroundColor: 'black', borderRadius: '1px solid grey', color: 'blue'}}>
<h1 style={{color: 'white'}}>?</h1>
</blockquote>
3. Is there an expectation of profit? No. Our mission statement clearly states that this is not an investment, and if it was, it would be a terrible one. The project itself is a self identified ‘art project’, and the function of the token is to illustrate not only the absurdity of the current space, but also as a form of credit to purchase ridiculous NFT’s (which are intended to be worthless). While we hope the project itself will be successful, we will evaluate that success by the engagement of our community and the impact of the art that we build. Our logo is a moon with a butt on it, and our homepage shows financial projections of the price tanking after the initial launch. With 0 ambiguity to our user base, our mission statement is extremely clear: “You’re already on the Moon, Let’s help you get back to earth”.  
<blockquote style={{padding: '10px', backgroundColor: 'black', borderRadius: '1px solid grey', color: 'blue'}}>
<h1 style={{color: 'green'}}>Pass</h1>
</blockquote>

We can now exit the 'exam', and feel relatively good about what we are trying to accomplish here...
<br/><br/>
<h1 style={{color: 'white'}}>Conclusion</h1>
The cryptocurrency space is a sexy, risky, and violently volatile space. It is up to you to run litmus tests (like the Howey test) to determine the long term longevity of all of these projects. 
<br/><br/>
Philisophically, by directing our attention towards humanity, DeFi, the arts, and the <i>common good</i>, we can pave a way forward that works with regulators (not against them) to usher in the next fiscal stage of evolution for the human race. The big boys have gotten their tongue wet, let’s let the DeFi virus take hold organically without shooting ourselves in the face.
